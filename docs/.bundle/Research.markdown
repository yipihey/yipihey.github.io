## Large Scale Structure Statistics
In a recent paper entitled ["Nearest Neighbor distributions: new statistical measures for cosmological clustering"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13342), [Arka Banerjee](https://arkabanerjee.github.io) and I kick off what we think will likely be a longer series of articles describing a new approach in how to make the most of galaxy clustering surveys.
