Here I highlight just a few of my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MKXVcVAAAAAJ&hl=en). 

## Cosmology

### Large Scale Structure Statistics
In this paper with [Arka Banerjee](https://arkabanerjee.github.io) entitled ["Nearest Neighbor distributions: new statistical measures for cosmological clustering"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13342), we kick off what we think will likely be a longer series of articles describing a new approach in how to make the most of galaxy clustering survey data.

### New Numerical Methods for Collisionless Fluids
On the tail end of my first sabbatical in 2011 I realized that cold collisionless fluids could be modelled using a three dimensional [tesselation of phase space sheets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3944). This idea we were able to extend to a wide variety of open problems such as how to measure [cosmic velocity fields](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.454.3920H/abstract), studying [voids in the cosmic web](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.458.4431W/abstract). We also used it to design more accurate [computational cosmology solvers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.434.1171H/abstract) which allowed us to avoid the notorious artificial fragmentation in [Simulations of Warm Dark Matter Scenarios](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.434.3337A/abstract).
