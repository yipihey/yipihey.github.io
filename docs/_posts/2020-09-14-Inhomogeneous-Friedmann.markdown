## The Inhomogeneous Friedmann Universe

To get insight on how structure like galaxies and the cosmic web they inhabit format we continue the previous discussion of [the Friedmann Universe]({% post_url 2020-09-10-Friedmann %}) and see what happens to initial inhomogeneities in this expanding background.

We saw that the Friedmann equation is:

$$\frac{\dot{a}^2 + kc^2/R_c^2}{a^2} = \frac{8 \pi G \rho + \Lambda c^2}{3}, $$

and that using $\rho_{crit,0}= {3H_0^2 \over 8\pi G}$ and $H=\dot{a}/a$ we could rewrite this as

$$H(a)^2= \Omega_{m,0}\,a^{-3} - \Omega_{k,0}\,a^{-2} + \Omega_\Lambda,
$$
where $\Omega_k= k c^2/R_c^2/\rho_{crit,0}$ and $\Omega_\Lambda = \Lambda c^2/3/\rho_{crit,0}$. One important thing to note is that all the $\Omega$s have to add up to 1. This is true at all times but we wrote the equation here so that we give all the $\Omega$s only at the time when $a=1$ and keep their (general versions) $a$ dependence explicit in the equation. This is indicated by using the subscript $0$ in $\Omega_{m,0}$. The zero refers to the cosmological redshift $1+z\equiv 1/a$ which is often used as an  way to denote which epoch of the Universe one is referring to. For a fixed cosmological model either of $a$, $z$, or time are used for this depending on what one is interesting to highlight. How much the light redshifts from that period to now, how old the Universe was or how much smaller a specific distance would have been at that time.

All $\Omega$s have to add to 1 by definition. In an analogy to the Newtonian equivalent equation the Friedmann equation is derived from the Energy condition. The $k$ denotes there whether the total energy is exactly zero, negative for a gravitational bound objects or positive for which the total energy would be positive.

Consider a flat background Universe with matter density $\rho_b$ but assuming its matter density, $\rho_i$ that is slightly different. We define a density contrast $\delta_i=\rho_i/\rho_b-1$.
