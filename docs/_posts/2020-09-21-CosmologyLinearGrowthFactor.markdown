In a fully matter dominated universe, a density fluctuation with density contrast $\delta_i(a_i)=\rho/\bar{\rho}-1$ at an initial scale factor of $a_i$ will grow this contrast proportional to $a$. Consequently, $\delta(a) = a \delta_i /a_i$.

The linear growth factor, $D_1(a)$ in cosmology is defined by the integral,

\\[
D_1(a) = \frac{5}{2} \Omega_{m,0}\frac{H(a)}{H_0} \int_0^a \left( \frac{a H(a)}{H_0} \right)^{-3} da
\\].

It describes how in general models of cosmology a small density perturbation grows via $\delta(a) = D_1(a) a \delta_i /a_i$.
