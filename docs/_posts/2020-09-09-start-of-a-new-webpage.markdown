My first [website](https://www.slac.stanford.edu/~tabel/) I started in 1994 while being at [NCSA](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu) just after Marc Andressen left to found [Netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape) using HTML. Many years later my sister in law was making fun of me of how unprofessional it looked and so I used iWeb on the MAC to make a [new one](tomabel.org). That went ok for a while but is defunct software now. So I here I am again trying something new using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) on [github](github.io).
