My first [website](https://www.slac.stanford.edu/~tabel/) I started in 1994 while being at [NCSA](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu) just after Marc Andressen left to found [Netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape) using HTML. Many years later my sister in law was making fun of me of how unprofessional it looked and so I used iWeb on the MAC to make a [new one](http://tomabel.org/Home/Welcome.html). That went ok for a while but is defunct software now. So I here I am again trying something new using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) on [github pages](https://pages.github.com). 
Wish me luck this decision will still make sense 10 years from now ... 
In the meantime my son Patrick redesigned the last one in [plain html and css](http://tomabel.org/)

We have MathJax support so some equations may now be allowed here such as $u \equiv \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}v\,f(v)dv$. That should be a plus... No?
